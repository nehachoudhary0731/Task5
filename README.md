# Sales Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates data analysis on sales data using Python and Pandas. The analysis focuses on data aggregation, handling missing values, and creating visualizations to derive business insights.

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.x
- Pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)
- Matplotlib (Data visualization)
- Seaborn (Statistical data visualization)
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Loading and Cleaning
- Load data from CSV files using pd.read_csv().
- Handle date columns and convert them to proper datetime format using pd.to_datetime().
- Identify and treat missing values using methods like dropna() or fillna().

### 2. Data Aggregation
- Group data using groupby() to summarize sales by product, region, or time period.
- Calculate key metrics like total sales, average sales, and growth trends.

### 3. Data Visualization
- Plot trends over time using line charts.
- Compare categories using bar plots.
- Explore relationships with scatter plots and correlation heatmaps.

## Business Insights
- Identify top-performing products and regions.
- Understand sales patterns over time.
- Detect anomalies or missing trends that could affect business strategy.
